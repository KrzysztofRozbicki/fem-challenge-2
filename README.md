## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

- How to use and position the background - although it was quite difficult at the start.
- To use svg as an decoration elements and position them.
- Way of 3dimensional placing elements with z-index.
- That I cannot use @extend in scss with @media query. 

### Continued development

Want to learn how to make more responsive, than adaptive layouts with such strict positioning from the designer.

## Acknowledgments

It is quite hard to make it fully responsive, as a lot of subtle details and positioning are changing in adaptive way due to design. I would recommend using @mixin for typography, I should have done it :)
